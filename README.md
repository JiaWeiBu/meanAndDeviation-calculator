Disclaimmer !!!
It does not have any graphic and some novice naming of the variable

Features

It contains all the variable needed to calculate the data so you can double check with a real calculator


How to use the calculator??
The program will prompt out a set of question, you can type out the function you want the program to do.
For example if you want a mean calculator you can type m when the prompt ask for it.
The alphabet being bracket is the letter you should type and it is in a loop untill the correct letter is typed out.
